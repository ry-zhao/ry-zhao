# Hi, I’m Ryan Zhao! 

I'm a linguist turned full-stack web developer and JavaScript fanatic. 

I have experience with building web apps using HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and Node.js.

I also dabble in Ruby and Clojure occasionally.

When I'm not programming I'm probably playing a game. I'm fond of Euro-style board games like Catan and Azul.
